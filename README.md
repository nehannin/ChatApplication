# **Chat Application**

Project for the Cross-Platform Mobile Application Development course.

## Project Overview

In the application, users can sign up and engage in real-time conversations with other users.

I built this app following the [Flutter Chat App Tutorial](https://supabase.com/blog/flutter-tutorial-building-a-chat-app) and the [Flutter Authorization with RLS](https://supabase.com/blog/flutter-authorization-with-rls) provided by Supabase. 

# **Setting Up and Running the Application:**
To set up the development environment and run the application, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code)
- A Supabase account

## Steps:
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run *flutter pub get* to install all the dependencies listed in **pubspec.yaml**.

2. Ensure your development environment is properly configured with an emulator or connected physical device.

3. Replace the Supabase URL and anonkey in the **main.dart** file with your own credentials.

4. Run *flutter run* to build and execute the application on your preferred device or emulator.
